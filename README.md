Title:

Weather & Air Quality Insights Dashboard:-
A modern Power BI dashboard that provides real-time weather forecasts, environmental conditions, and air quality metrics across major Indian cities with an engaging dark-themed design.

Description:

The Dashboard is designed to help users monitor and analyze both weather patterns and air quality indicators in a single interactive view. It combines temperature trends, sunrise/sunset times, rainfall probability, and pollutant concentration levels to give citizens, policymakers, and environmental analysts actionable insights for daily planning and health awareness.

Tech stack:

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

‚Ä¢ üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì Core data visualization and report building tool.

‚Ä¢ üìÇ Power Query ‚Äì DData cleaning, structuring, and transformation.

‚Ä¢ üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Custom measures, AQI categorization, and conditional formatting.

‚Ä¢ üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.

‚Ä¢ üìÅ File Format ‚Äì ..pbix (development), .png (screenshots for preview).

Data Source:

Weather Data:- WeatherAPI (forecast and current weather conditions).

Air Quality Data:- WeatherAPI Datasets (CO, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, PM10, O‚ÇÉ).

Geographic Context:- Sunrise/sunset times and city-level weather metrics.

Data is structured into daily forecasts and real-time environmental readings for cross-comparison.

Features / Highlights:

‚Ä¢ Business Problem

Citizens and organizations face challenges in monitoring real-time environmental conditions across multiple sources. Weather forecasts are usually separate from air quality data, making it difficult to plan outdoor activities, logistics, or policy responses.

‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard

To integrate weather forecasts and air quality indices into a single, visually engaging Power BI report that:

1. Helps citizens assess health risks before outdoor activities

2. Supports organizations in logistics and event planning

3. Provides analysts with pollutant breakdowns for environmental research

‚Ä¢ Walkthrough of Key Visuals

1. Current Weather Panel (Top Left): Displays temperature, condition (Mist, Rain, etc.), and comparisons across multiple cities (Cochin, Bengaluru, Chennai).

2. 7-Day Forecast Chart: Line chart showing predicted temperature trends for the upcoming week.

3. Sunrise & Sunset Timings: Simple icons + text for easy day planning.

4. Weather KPIs: Cards showing humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, precipitation, and UV index.

5. Air Quality Index (Center): Circular gauge displaying AQI level with health advisory (‚ÄúVery Unhealthy‚Äù), along with pollutant breakdowns (CO, SO‚ÇÇ, NO‚ÇÇ, PM10, O‚ÇÉ, Defra Index).

6. Chances of Rain (Right Panel): Daily rain probability visualized with horizontal bars (color-coded).

‚Ä¢ Business Impact & Insights

1. Public Health Awareness: Citizens can check AQI and pollutant breakdown to avoid exposure during ‚ÄúVery Unhealthy‚Äù conditions.

2. Daily Planning: Commuters, travelers, and event organizers can plan activities with sunrise/sunset, precipitation, and forecast data.

3. Policy & Research Support: Environmental agencies can use pollutant breakdowns (NO‚ÇÇ, PM10, CO) to identify pollution hotspots and recommend mitigation strategies.

4. Decision-Making Efficiency: Brings together weather + AQI data in one dashboard instead of scattered sources.on: Travel agencies can use this dashboard to identify key selling points for different demographics (e.g., child-friendly resorts or expert terrain). Strategic Expansion: Resort developers can spot underdeveloped regions with high potential. Vacation Planning: Tourists can plan trips based on slope availability, elevation, and terrain difficulty. Regional Analysis: Governments and tourism bodies can analyze competitiveness by region.
